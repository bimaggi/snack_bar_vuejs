# snack_bar

## Project developed in Vuejs 

This project allows the user to assemble their own snack on the " Make your burguer" page, with options for breads, meats, options, side dishes and drinks. After confirming the order, a modal opens for the user to make the payment.
Filling in all fields is mandatory for the order to be placed. The validity of the card is also analyzed to verify that the card is not expired.
On the Request page, you can check the order data and also change the order status.
Project can still be implemented so that the user can track the status of the order or make the cancellation.
